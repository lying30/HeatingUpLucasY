| January 15 | 12:35-1:45pm |                                                                                                                                          I thought about the how to solve this using an algorithm that tracks each count for every day. |

| Jan 22     | 8pm-10:36pm  | I implemented the adjacency list and the recursion by updating my previous solution and adding another method to call into for recursion. I didn't have to make too many changes but their were some changes with the logic obviously.  |
