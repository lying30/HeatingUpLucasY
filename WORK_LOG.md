| January 15 | 12:35-1:45pm |                                                         I thought about the how to solve this using an algorithm that tracks each count for every day. |
| Jan. 16    |  8pm-9:20pm  | Finished my v1 implementation by tweaking my program so it looped through and updated the count and longest count as it went through the temperatures. |
